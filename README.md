# Lotus Loader

This was a small mod I developed for MelonLoader to be used on the game "VRChat" two years ago to load my much larger mod "Lotus".
The reason being, although this would require downloading data every launch, it would mitigate the need for a large scale new file posting for many people to download. This in turn also kept users getting the most up to date "Lotus" mod as soon as it is published without having to do any extra work.

EmmVRC: Although I didn't paste or use their loader's code. I did glance at it for some reference.
